# QuickSC
Quick Screen Capture is a screenshot capture utility written in C++ with MFC during Windows XP days. It can capture the entire screen or a selected application window based on user choice. 

This was a fun project and has no practical value in 2024, however the code used here can be used for any Windows programming if required.
